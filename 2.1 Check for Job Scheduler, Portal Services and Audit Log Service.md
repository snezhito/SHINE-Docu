## Check for Job Scheduler, Portal Services and Audit Log Service
SHINE for XSA needs a job scheduler service broker to create a job scheduler service. The Fiori Launchpad in SHINE needs the portal services application to be installed. 

For this, the XSA components: XSAC_SERVICES and XSAC_PORTAL_SERVICES need to be installed in the SAP space of the system. SHINE also needs the audit log service to log messages for changes in transactional data. 

Use the following code sample to check if all the required components are already installed there.
