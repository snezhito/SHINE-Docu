## Check for Job Scheduler, Portal Services and Audit Log Service
SHINE for XSA needs a job scheduler service broker to create a job scheduler service. The Fiori Launchpad in SHINE needs the portal services application to be installed. 

For this, the XSA components XSAC_SERVICES and XSAC_PORTAL_SERVICES need to be installed in the SAP space of the system. SHINE also needs the audit log service to log messages for changes in the transactional data. 

Use the following code sample to check if all the required components are already installed there.
```
xs marketplace 
```

If any of them is not installed, contact your system administrator to install the necessary components on the SAP space.

To enable SAP HANA audit logging, proceed as follows:
1.	Create an xsa audit-log policy for the following actions: SECURITY EVENT, PERSONAL DATA ACCESS, PERSONAL DATA MODIFICATION, and CONFIGURATION CHANGE. 
For example, in SAP HANA Studio, right click on the system name, click *Open SQL Console* and execute the following SQL query:
```
create audit policy xsa_audit auditing all SECURITY EVENT, PERSONAL DATA ACCESS, PERSONAL DATA MODIFICATION, CONFIGURATION CHANGE level info;
ALTER AUDIT POLICY xsa_audit ENABLE;
```
